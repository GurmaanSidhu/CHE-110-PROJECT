                        <p>Rainwater harvesting is a simple strategy by which rainfall is gathered and stored for future usage. The process involves collection and storage of rainwater with help of artificially designed systems, that runs off naturally or man-made catchment areas e.g. rooftop, compounds, rocky surface, hill slopes.</p>

                        <h3 class="intro-why__heading tertiary-heading">Why harvest rainwater?</h3>
                        <p>Harvesting rainwater allows the collection of large amounts of water and mitigates the effects of drought. Most rooftops provide the necessary platform for collecting water. Rainwater is mostly free from harmful chemicals, which makes it suitable for irrigation purposes.</p>

                        <p>The collected rainwater from surfaces on which rain falls may be filtered, stored and utilized in different ways or directly used for recharge purposes. Rainwater Harvesting is unrestricted from any kind of impurity, with relatively less storage cost and no maintenance cost involved except for periodical cleaning.</p>

                        <h4 class="review-h4">Reduced Water Bills</h4>
                        <p>Rainwater harvesting systems are cost-effective, provide high-quality water, lessens dependence on wells and are considerably easy to maintain since they are not utilized for drinking, cooking or other sensitive uses. The all-around expenditures used in setting up harvesting methods are much cheaper compared to other purifying or pumping means. The cost of recharge to the subsurface reservoir is also lower than the surface reservoirs.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="review-sub__parts">
                        <h4 class="review-h4">Reduces erosion and flooding around buildings</h4>
                        <p>It reduces soil erosion and flood hazards by collecting rainwater and reducing the flow of stormwater to prevent urban flooding. Most buildings that utilize rainwater harvesting systems have a built-in catchment area on top of the roof, which has a capacity of collecting large volumes of water in case of rainstorms.</p>
                    </div>

            <p>Ministry of Jal Shakti, Department of Water Resources, RD & GR (DoWR, RD & GR) is implementing Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal), a Rs. 6,000 crore Central Sector Scheme, for sustainable management of ground water resources with community participation. Atal Jal is being implemented in 81 water stressed districts and 8,774 Gram Panchayats of seven States viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The scheme includes innovative recharge structures including rain water harvesting structures.</p> <br>
            <p>Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) in 2019 which continued during 2021 also to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the country including Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana. Further, the campaign “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” (JSA:CTR) was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 22 March 2021. In addition, under JSA:CTR, 10.65 Lakh water conservation/rain water harvesting works, 1.79 Lakh renovation works of traditional water bodies completed (as on 07.02.2022) in the country.</p><br>
            <p>Further, the Department has also taken up some works for groundwater augmentation through artificial recharge in certain water stressed blocks of Rajasthan and Haryana. <br> <br>

            In addition, a number of States have done notable work in the field of water conservation/harvesting such as ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Jalyukt Shibar’ in Maharashtra, ‘Sujalam Sufalam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh, Jal Jeevan Hariyali in Bihar, ‘Jal Hi Jeevan’ in Haryana, and Kudimaramath scheme in Tamil Nadu. <br> <br>
                
            Central Government generally support construction of water harvesting through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC)  and Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) scheme & Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies Schemes.

        <h3 class="tertiary-heading main-heading">History</h3>
        <p>The organized collection of dew or condensation through natural or assisted processes is an ancient practice, from the small-scale drinking of pools of condensation collected in plant stems (still practiced today by survivalists), to large-scale natural irrigation without rain falling, such as in the Atacama and Namib deserts.<strong> The first man-made fog collectors stretch back as far as the Inca Empire, where buckets were placed under trees to take advantage of condensation.</strong> <br><br>
        One of the first recorded projects of fog collection was in 1969 in South Africa as a water source for an air force base. The structure consisted of two fences each 100m2. Between the two, 11 litres of water was produced on average per day over the 14 month study, which is 0.05 litres of water for every square meter. The next large study was performed by the National Catholic University of Chile and the International Development Research Centre in Canada in 1987. One hundred 48m2 fog fences were assembled in northern Italy. The project was able to yield on average 0.5 litre of water for every square meter, or 33L for each of the 300 villagers, each day.</p>

        <h3 class="tertiary-heading main-heading">Setup and Material Used</h3>

                                Life is so wonderful for us, most importantly we save time where we use to waste 4 to 5 hours every day. But now we have water pipes in the kitchen, in the toilet, and Hall and we even have a washing machine. We don't have to struggle with water anymore. Thanks be to God.  🙏🙏

                                We now are able to grow fruits and vegetables and provide our family a healthier diet. I can say what a huge difference the fog water has made to my family anf the lives of everyone involved with it. We can use the time spent looking for water to do other things most importanly I now have time to think about my self and my future. I can now harvest throughout the year thanks to the regular water supply from the Cloud Fisher.

            <p class="para69">To sum up everything, Fog Collectors are placed on high hilly areas, as the fog is mostly found at the higher atmosphere. This method is mostly used in African countries, as there is water scarity and high hills suitable for fog collecting. On average these Fog Collectors help around +20 villages and make their living better. Furthermore the expense of using this methodology is not much. It also create job opportunities for the new youth of the region. Fog Collector is becoming hot topic day-by-day as many institution are researching on it and even implementing it.</p>

            <p>Rainwater harvesting, the practice of collecting and storing rain for later use, holds a strong correlation with several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Its most significant impact is on SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), where rainwater harvesting contributes to enhancing water security by providing an alternative, sustainable, and local source of freshwater. It mitigates the effects of water scarcity, particularly in regions facing water stress due to climate change or population growth. Further, it also aligns with SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), where urban rainwater harvesting systems can alleviate pressure on municipal water supplies and reduce flood risks. In relation to SDG 13 (Climate Action), rainwater harvesting provides climate resilience by securing water resources under changing climate patterns. Additionally, with appropriate implementation, it can support SDG 15 (Life on Land) by reducing soil erosion and replenishing groundwater levels, contributing to ecosystem health. Thus, rainwater harvesting offers a cross-cutting and valuable strategy in the pursuit of sustainable development.</p>
